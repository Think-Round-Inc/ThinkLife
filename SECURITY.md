# Security Policy

ThinkLife is committed to the security and privacy of its users.  This document describes our process for reporting and handling vulnerabilities in the ThinkLife codebase.

## Supported Versions

| Branch / Version | Supported?      | Notes                          |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| `main`           | Yes (latest)    | All new fixes land here first  |
| `Collborator`          | Yes             | Mirrors `main` via CI/CD       |

We aim to provide security fixes for all supported branches.  Please report any issues you find against the branch you’re using.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please use **one** of the methods below:

### 1. GitHub Security Advisory (recommended)
1. Go to the **Security → Advisories** tab of the Think-Round-Inc/ThinkLife repository.
2. Click **“New draft”** to open a private advisory.
3. Provide as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, impact, suggested fix).

GitHub will keep your report private until a fix is ready for public disclosure.

### 2. Email
Send an encrypted or plain-text email to: info@thinkround.org


Subject line: `Security vulnerability in ThinkLife`

Include:
